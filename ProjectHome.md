This is a small desktop program that browses the irctc.co.in website and helps books tickets faster!

Currently it is able to attempt to book tatkal tickets at 8am. Ability to book normal tickets will be added soon.

The application ensures minimal data transfer between your computer and the irctc website making booking tickets faster than any other web browser.

Also it saves you a lot of clicks and painful repetition of tasks at the error prone irctc website.

It collects no personally identifiable information and has an opt-in to collect usage stats.

Currently it is a work in progress and the first stable version will be released soon. Check this page for releases.
